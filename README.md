Responsive Table JS
===================

Responsive Tables JS is a simple and fast method for making any table responsive

Usage
------

* jQuery is required - tested with 2.x (should work with previous versions too)
* Just insert the js script, css stylesheet and add the class **responsive** to your table.
* The table must have **th** tags to work
* For chrome : <!DOCTYPE html> is required!

**Example:**

Include:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="responsiveimages.css" />
    <script src="responsiveimages.js"></script>
 
Table:

    <table class="responsive">
    <tr >
        <th>
            Title 1
        </th>
        <th>
            Title 2
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td >
            Row 1
        </td>
        <td >
            Row 1
        </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
